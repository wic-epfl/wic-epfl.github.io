						<h3>Code of Conduct for Women+ in IC events.</h3>
						<p>While most of your events are mixed, maintaining a few non-mixed events ensures that the association is inclusive of all members' needs, recognizing that different spaces serve different purposes. The â€œwomen+ only" shortcut helps quickly convey the intention behind these events, ensuring they remain a safe and supportive environment for those who need it most.</p>

						<p> As an ally at our events, be mindful of the space you occupy, both physically and in conversation, and be open to feedback if something you say or do is called out as problematic. Instead of becoming defensive, take time to reflect and learn from the experience.</p>
